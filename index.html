				<h3 id="courses"><strong>Our courses!</strong></h3>
				<p>We believe the professional development is a key area if teachers want
					to
					continue developing, improving and enjoying their daily practice. <br /> <br />

					We also understand that each teacher faces a unique challenge since the
					context is different and therefore, needs and wants are different in each
					one of our students. In order to make sure our courses are helpful, we make
					decisions taking these two principles into consideration: <br />

					1. You (as our student) are responsible for your own growth and you are
					capable of making your own decisions regarding your own learning and
					professional development. <br />

					2. Personalized formative feedback is essential to permanent growth for
					anyone interested in their professional development. <br />

					That is why we pay very close attention to your unique circumstances and use
					all our experience and knowledge to help you as much as we can.</p>
